## Description

This ReadMe Generator creates a new readMe file using command line prompts. Javascript and nodeJs are the two main technologies used for this project. Project title, description, installation instructions, usage instructions, chosen license and its corresponding badge, test, and developer's contact information in case of questions are added to the newReadMe.md file. The generated readme follows best practices with formatting so that the user input easily fits into the page.
